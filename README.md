# ABout Notes App
  This app is made for writting and saving notes at one place. To add a note simply touch the 3 dots in the right hand side of the action bar and the click "Add Note", then the app will direct the user to the editor. Just type and that's it, when you press the back button or exit the app, it will autosave the note and all the notes would be displayed when next time the app is opened.
